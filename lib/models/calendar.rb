# The Calendar module provides access to remote calendars to JBot plugins. It
# currently pulls events from a Google Calendar as the default backend. The
# events are filtered so that only live events (where the title starts with
# 'LIVE: ') are fetched. To get a Calendar object, use
# `Calendar.new(config_data)` to get a duck-typed Calendar object that meets the
# following interface:
#
#   Calendar#events: returns an array of Calendar::CalendarEvents
#
# A Calendar::CalendarEvent object holds basic event data, and provides the
# following (read-only) attributes:
#
#   summary:    (string) The title of the event, with 'LIVE: ' prefix removed.
#   start_time: (DateTime) The start time of the event.
#   end_time:   (DateTime) The end time of the event.
module Calendar
  # Create a new Calendar object, here a GoogleCalendar object. This method is a
  # factory method to get a Calendar duck-subtype object.
  # A Calendar object fetches a remote calendar feed. Those events can then be
  # retrieved as an array of Calendar::CalendarEvent objects.
  #
  # param config: The `config` parameter is a hash of configuration data.
  # Currently, it pulls in the parameters required to call out to the Google
  # Calendar API. A simple way to have all this set is to pass the Cinch plugin
  # config object into this method, and set all the required fields in the
  # cinchize.yml config file. The hash has the following required keys:
  #
  #   app_name:    The name of your application
  #   app_version: The version of your application
  #   calendar_id: The Google Calendar ID of the calendar you want to use
  #   api_key:     Your API key for the Google Calendar API
  #
  # The `app_name` and `app_version` fields can be arbitrary, and are for
  # Google's use. The calendar_id is of the form:
  #
  #   CALENDARIDHERE@group.calendar.google.com
  #
  # and is embedded in your calendar's URLs. The api_key must be obtained from
  # Google through their API Console at https://code.google.com/apis/console
  #
  # TODO: Right now, this errors out on missing/invalid config. It should
  #   instead return a NullCalendar object that returns no events.
