# The Show class holds data for a specific show. In addition to being a data
# container, it also provides for matching a search term. The following
# (read-only) attributes are available:
#
#   title:   (string) The show's title
#   url:     (string) The URL slug of the show
#   rss:     (string) The RSS feed URL of the show
#   aliases: (array[string]) An array of aliases that can additionally match
#     the show

  #   url: (string) The URL slug of the show
  #   rss: (string) The RSS feed URL of the show
  #   aliases: (array[string]) [Optional] An array of aliases
  #   channel: (string) The IRC channel the show uses
